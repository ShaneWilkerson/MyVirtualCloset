## Migration for Existing Users

To update existing users in your Firebase database to include the `isPublic` field:

1. **Option 1: Use the FirestoreTest Component**
   - Navigate to the FirestoreTest component in your app
   - Tap the "Update Existing Users (Add isPublic field)" button
   - Confirm the migration

2. **Option 2: Run the Migration Script**
   - Import and call `updateExistingUsers()` from `frontend/utils/updateExistingUsers.js`
   - This will update all existing users to have `isPublic: true`

## Firebase Rules

The current Firebase rules support the new `isPublic` field:

### Firestore Rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    // ... other rules
  }
}
```

### Storage Rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /clothing/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write, delete: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /{allOtherPaths=**} {
      allow read, write, delete: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

## Code Comments

All new code includes student-friendly comments explaining:
- What each function does
- How the toggle switch works
- Firebase operations and their purposes
- Navigation flow between screens
- Error handling and user feedback

## Usage

### For Users:
1. Navigate to the Social tab
2. Tap the gear icon (settings) in the header
3. Use the toggle switch to change privacy settings
4. Changes are saved automatically

### For Developers:
- The `isPublic` field can be used to control visibility of user content
- Check `userData.isPublic` before showing user content to others
- The field defaults to `true` for all users

## Future Enhancements

The notifications bell icon is currently a placeholder. Future features could include:
- Push notifications for social interactions
- Friend requests and approvals
- Outfit sharing and likes
- Activity feed with privacy controls

## Testing

To test the features:
1. Create a new user account (should have `isPublic: true` by default)
2. Navigate to Social â†’ Settings
3. Toggle the privacy setting
4. Check Firestore to verify the field is updated
5. Test with existing users using the migration utility
